# Covid-info
beginner at python flexing some code

The following 4 code files represent a couple of hours of work:
File one - A simple choropleth map of the United States shaded by case count per county

File two - Some data transformations updating information from The Census Bureau by yours truly. Most of the transformations for this code were not preserved.
Information merged into one data frame includes: population by county, land area by county, NY times covid data, mask survey data, etc.

File 3 - includes code to update csv provided in file 2 to current covid data from NY Times github account

File 4 - Further analysis of Covid Data, with some more visualizations
